On linux:

## Dependencies
Install package dependencis required for the app by entering `npm install`. This have to be entered inside frontend and backend directory each.

## Build & Run
After installing necessary dependencies, start the app by running the nodemon service.

On backend directory,
```
npm start
```

On frontend directory,
```
npm run dev

**NOTE:** The backend requires a special `.env` file to run properly, this contains various secret keys, database authentications etc. For security this has been exempted from the github repository. Please contact one of the repository maintainers for the access.


## Issues
Sometimes one or both of the app servers may fail to run. This can occur due to some node packages not being correctly installed. Simply enter the following command to force installed required packages

```
npm install -f
```

Then enter `npm start` or `npm rub dev` depending on which app you are trying to run.
